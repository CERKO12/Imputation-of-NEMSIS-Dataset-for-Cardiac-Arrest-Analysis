### Story with objectives:
Critical Care Doctors at MaineHealth are intensively looking into data from cardiac arrest patients in the ICU with the goal of identifying predictors that influence patient outcomes. The extensive National Emergency Medical System (NEMSIS) database, containing nationwide 911 calls, offers a significant dataset for such research. Through this project, the primary analytical objectives are:

1. Conduct reproducible exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
2. Assess the impact of different imputation methods, specifically MICE and missforest, on the dataset.
3. Find the predictors of cardiac arrest patients' outcomes.

### Data:
* Original data source: [NEMSIS Database](https://www.nemsis.org/)
* A subset of the entire database is available via scientists at The Roux Institute.

### GitHub-pages Concept:
1. Home Page: Introduction to the project and stakeholder details.
2. Data: Details about the data sources.
3. Analysis: Display reproducible EDA, imputation methodologies, and any preliminary modeling results.
4. Portfolio: A visual gallery of plots, charts, and tables derived from the analysis.
