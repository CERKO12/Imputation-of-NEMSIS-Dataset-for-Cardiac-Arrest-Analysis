### Milestones & Timeline
* Week 1-2: Data Acquisition and Pre-processing
  * Obtain the dataset from stakeholders.
  * Perform initial data cleaning and identify missing data points.
    
* Week 3-4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Visualize the dataset to identify patterns and trends.
  * Statistical analysis.
    
* Week 5-6: Data Imputation
  * Apply MICE and missforest algorithms to handle missing data.
  * Compare the original dataset with the imputed ones to evaluate the effectiveness of the imputation methods.
    
* Week 7-8: Model Preliminaries
  * Transform the reproducible dataset for modeling convenience.
  * Determine potential modeling techniques to adopt.
  * Start with basic modeling to identify any issues or improvements needed.

* Week 9-10: Final Model Development and Validation
  * Find the correlations among each column, primary focus on urbanicity and outcomes.
  * Complete model development.
  * Validate using separate test data to evaluate its performance.
